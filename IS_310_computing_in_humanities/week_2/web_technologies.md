<h3> 1. Web technologies:</h3>

<p> The digital library was built using several different web technologies. HTML/CSS were both used for structuring and styling of the site using, none other then, markup. JavaScript was used in the frontend to enhance interaction and provide dynamic content. I decided to use an AI to help me find out if other etchnologies were used, and they sure were. Ruby on Rails, a popular web application framework that build DPLA's backend.As well as APIs that are intergated in to exchange data between systems and aggregate digital collections from libraries. </p>
<h3> 2. Creators</h3>
<p> The Digital Public Library of America was built through a collaborative effort involving Harvard Universityâ€™s Berkman Center for Internet & Society and support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. My guess would have to be that hundreds of individuals contributed in some way, just based on how many web technologies were used in the creation process.
